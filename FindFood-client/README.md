# Problem

In today's digital age, the convenience of food delivery apps such as DoorDash and Uber Eats, as well as direct online orders from restaurants, has become a common practice.

Navigating through these platforms can be a source of frustration when seeking essential information, such as avoiding allergic foods or adhering to specific dietary restrictions. 

Coordinating group food orders presents its own set of challenges, especially when accommodating individual preferences for specific types of meat.
